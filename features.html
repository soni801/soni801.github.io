			<h1>Features</h1>
			<p>The custom features we have this season are:</p>
			<h3>Custom Paintings</h3>
			<p>Custom paintings make it possible to express yourself in completely different ways than in vanilla minecraft. Our custom paintings are:<br> - World Map<br> - District Map<br> - TV<br> - CodeBlock Logo</p>
			<h3>Custom Texts</h3>
			<p>Some of the texts in the game, like the credits, have been updated to make them funnier to read.</p>
			<h3>Custom Commands</h3>
			<p>Custom commands make you able to do much more than you previously could. The possibilities are almost endless. For more info on the custom commmands, take a look at the commands tab.</p>
			<h3>Vanilla Tweaks</h3>
			<p>CodeBlock uses a datapack collection called Vanilla Tweaks. These are made by the team over at <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/">https://vanillatweaks.net/</a>. All features below are from this.</p>
			<h3>Multiplayer Sleep</h3>
			<p>Multiplayer Sleep makes us able to skip the night when only one player is sleeping. This makes it much easier to sleep on larger servers, where all players may not be able to sleep at the same time.</p>
			<h3>Player Graves</h3>
			<p>When a player dies, a grave spawns at the death location with all the players items. Only the grave owner can regain their items by crouching on top of the grave.</p>
